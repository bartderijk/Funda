// Exposing the api key is bad practice.
// Normally I'd get the key from the backend and/or render it in the template on the server side.

// For this exercise I'm simply leaving it out as the scope is limited to frontend.
// You can set the key here as a value for apiKey:
const apiKey = '';
export { apiKey as default };
