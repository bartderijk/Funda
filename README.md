To start off you'll need an `API key`, which can be found in the assignemt's brieving.
Add it in `config.js` in the root, and you're good to go.

Install the app with `npm ci` then run `npm run serve` for development, or `npm run build` for a more optimized build.
Still on the todo list are e2e tests, and I wasn't able to finish up the unit tests within the time limits.

If anything's unclear, please reach out. I'm more than happy to help.

Best,
Bart
